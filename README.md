# Writing Rules
Refer into PEP8(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) Python writing guide, some simple rules that must be implemented:
1. Use lowercase letters for function and variables, delimited with underscore (snake_case), for example: connect_to_drive(), add_columns(). Do Not use camelCase() or kebab-case() or PascalCase(). 
2. Use UPPERCASE letters for constants  
3. Comments and functions are written in english.

All of those rules are enforced so we can put this project into our portofolio.
